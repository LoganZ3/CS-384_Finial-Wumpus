This is where I will have all information for part 2 of the assignment:

2:
a. The game andd map work though in a rough way. need to edit code to make map larger or change player start. Github actions also work

b. Docker is set up to the best of my ability but cannot get it to work. Wumpus AI is strange and does not display location when shot.

c. Used help from Rosseta code (https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) was a great tool to learn what Wumpus hunting is. 
Nearly all my help game from this site from Wumpus AI to map creation.

Used AI for template help or basic function with explanations for things not given by Rosseta Code.
(Example Prompt: Can you explain and help me build unit tests that are run using Github Actions. Ive never used github action before and would like to learn how to use them please explain well)

3: AI was a great help for the 'easy' parts of the assignment. For simple things like structure and formatting it was great, but if i needed a minor tweak this is where issues would arise.
I found it easier to explain how to fix an issue and to fix it myself ratherr than having AI go and alter existing code.
The biggest issue is that AI would try to alter existing code and even variable names which do not match other files or calls.
